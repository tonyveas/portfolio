                    Just because we can't get out and about like we normally
                    would, doesn’t mean we have to taking pictures. There’s
                    still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to use
                    some imagination. Here are a few ideas to keep you shooting
                    until normal life resumes.

                    Most photographers love to shoot the unusual, and you don’t
                    get much more unusual than These Unprecedented Times. Right
                    now everything counts as out of the ordinary. There are a
                    number of remarkable things about these lockdown days that
                    are worth photographing now we can remember them when it is
                    all over.

                    Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can
                    evoke the sense of historical pictures from before the
                    invention of the motorcar. Other things that are different
                    at the moment will be queues to get into stores and the
                    lines marked out on the floor to show how far apart we
                    should be.
